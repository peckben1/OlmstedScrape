# OlmstedScrape

This notebook was created to aid in a historical research project involving the Olmsted firm of landscape architects. The original plans and photographs held at Olmsted National Historic Site in Brookline, MA have been digitized and uploaded to Flickr along with metadata descriptions. This notebook uses a python wrapper for the Flickr API to locate and download original images from ONHS photosets relating to relevant Olmsted firm job numbers, parsing the descriptions to generate a metadata .csv file. Due to formatting inconsistencies and errors in the human-entered descriptions and titles, the code had to be fairly robust for a simple, narrowly-applicable scraper. On its most recent running as of this writing, the notebook was successfully used to download and log metadata for approximately 5,000 images, some 25 GB of material, over a multi-hour run. 

The public version of the notebook is not functional in its current state, as the Flickr API key, secret, ONHS user ID, and destination file path have been removed.
